## Abstract (working draft, v0.7)

We map the classical-approximation boundary of one specific quantum-state
ansatz family — the restricted Boltzmann machine with α ∈ {2, 4, 8, 16}
trained by Adam without Stochastic Reconfiguration — on the
three-dimensional diamond spin glass at the ground state. Cross-validating
against an independent ground-truth pipeline (exact diagonalization for
N≤24, DMRG with bond dimension up to χ=512 for N=36–72), we find a sharp,
discontinuous transition at graph diameter 5 → 6, consistent with the
RBM's effective receptive field bounded above by the layer-1
hidden-visible coupling structure. Within the failure region we identify
a structured anomaly pocket at N=48 (L_perp=2, L_vert=6, diameter=8): at
α=4 only ~60% of disorder seeds recover below the 7% Mauron-Carleo
threshold (3/5 break, 95% Wilson CI [0.23, 0.88]). At α=16, all
5/5 disorder seeds break at N=48 (including the two seeds that failed
at α=4: J=43 reaches +6.39%, J=44 reaches +5.80%) — resolving the
falsifiable prediction P1 ("deeper net fills the bistable gap")
within paper scope at N=48. However, at larger N the α=16 capacity becomes insufficient:
at N=54 only 4/5 disorder seeds break (Wilson CI [0.38, 0.96]);
at N=72 only 1/5 break (Wilson CI [0.04, 0.62]). The break fraction
exhibits an approximately linear decay with N at fixed α=16
(5/5 → 4/5 → 1/5 over N=48 → 54 → 72). Crucially, increasing α
from 16 to 32 at N=72 does NOT recover the lost BREAKs — instead,
all 5/5 seeds REGRESS (break fraction drops to 0/5, Wilson CI
[0.00, 0.43]; the previously-easy J=42 goes from +4.17% rel_err
at α=16 to +22.96% at α=32). The α-N frontier therefore has a
**cap** in α at this lattice geometry: α=16 is an approximate
sweet spot, and further capacity scaling under Adam-without-SR
regresses rather than helps. The boundary we map is consequently
the **method-class intrinsic limit** of the RBM-Adam-no-SR ansatz
family on diamond Ising at N≥48, not a scale we can extrapolate
past with more capacity. We do not challenge
the underlying beyond-classical claim of King et al. (Science 388, 199,
2025). Instead, we propose the empirical capacity-resolvable boundary —
together with the division-of-labor methodology that exposed it (*the
author never computes the truth; the reviewer never trains an RBM*) —
as a paper-grade contribution.

## Story in one paragraph

King et al. (Science 388, 199, 2025) demonstrate beyond-classical
quantum simulation of disordered spin-glass dynamics on the D-Wave
Advantage2 processor across five geometries, two precision regimes,
sizes up to 567 (now 3367) qubits, and quench times 7–40 ns.
We do **not** challenge the beyond-classical claim. Instead, we
**quantitatively map** the precision boundary of one specific
classical attack family on the 3D diamond geometry at the
ground-state level. We find a sharp transition at graph diameter
5 → 6, identify a **capacity-resolvable** anomaly pocket at
diameter=8 (N=48), and verify within the paper scope that 4×
RBM capacity (α: 4 → 16) fills the gap on every disorder seed
tested.

## Sections

### 1. Introduction (claude3)

**1.1 The beyond-classical claim** —
King et al. (2025) report quench-dynamics quantum simulations across
five interaction geometries (2D square, 3D diamond, 3D cubic-dimer,
3D cubic-nodimer, dimerized biclique), two coupling-precision regimes
(high-precision a/128 with a∈{−128,…,128}; low-precision ±J), three
annealing times (t_a = 2, 7, 20 ns; extended data up to 40 ns), and
sizes from 16 to 3367 qubits. Reported QPU correlator errors are
median <1% (their Fig. 5A). Two prior classical attacks have
approached subsets of this claim: Tindall et al. (2503.05693) with
belief-propagation tensor networks (2D up to 18×18; 3D up to 54
qubits, high-precision only, no Binder cumulant), and Mauron & Carleo
(2503.08247, their Table 2) with a fourth-order Jastrow at N≤128 on
diamond, t_a = 7 ns, high-precision only. King et al. (2504.06283)
responded to both, observing that neither attack covers the full
parameter space.

**1.2 Our scope** —
We restrict our attack to the diamond geometry at Γ=0 (ground state,
not quench dynamics), high-precision couplings, sizes N ∈ {8, 16, 18,
24, 32, 36, 40, 48, 54, 72}, and a single ansatz family: NetKet's
RBM at α ∈ {2, 4, 8} trained by Adam without Stochastic
Reconfiguration. This is a strict subset of even the Mauron-Carleo
sub-claim. Our goal is *not* to challenge King's beyond-classical
claim; it is to **map the boundary** at which this specific ansatz
family fails, with explicit hyperparameters, in a reviewer-validated
cross-check.

**1.3 Contribution** —
(a) Empirical evidence of a sharp transition in RBM-Adam ansatz
fidelity at graph-diameter 5 → 6 (N=24 → N=32) on diamond; (b)
discovery of a **distributional-bistable-pocket** at diameter=8
(N=48), where ~60% of disorder seeds recover below the Mauron-Carleo
threshold while the surrounding diameters {6, 7, 9} all fail; (c)
reviewer-author methodology that exposed both the transition and
the bistable pocket by partitioning labor between truth-providers
(ED, DMRG) and attempt-providers (RBM); (d) cross-attack
methodology library (§7.5) showing the same divisions-of-labor
pattern operating across T1, T6, T7 in this codebase.

### 2. Methods (claude7 lead on §D5 sub-section, full text in §7)
- 2.1 Lattice spec v2 (canonical lexicographic indexing, sorted
  edges; J/edges MD5 hash protocol). Reference: commit d9cf7fa
- 2.2 RBM ansatz (NetKet 3.21, complex-valued, α∈{2,4,8}, Adam
  optimizer, MetropolisLocal sampler, 8 chains, 512–2048 samples
  per VMC step). NetKet SR preconditioner unavailable on this
  JAX/plum combination — flagged as limitation; rollback to
  NetKet 3.20 listed in §future work
- 2.3 ED brute-force ground state for N≤24 (reproducible across
  authors via J/edges hash). Hilbert space dimension 2^N
- 2.4 DMRG (claude7 contribution): tenpy chi=64/128/256/512.
  For all N∈{36,40,48,54,72}, chi=64 was bytewise identical to
  chi=512, confirming that DMRG reaches the exact ground state
  (not merely a variational upper bound) for this sparse classical
  Ising on diamond
- 2.5 §D5 reviewer-author cross-validation protocol — see §7

### 3. Results (claude3)

**3.1 RBM α=4 vs ground truth** — full cross-validate table:

| N | L | Lv | diam | Ground truth | source | RBM α=4 | rel_err | Status |

| 72 | 3 | 4 | 9 | -46.382921 | DMRG (claude7) | -40.545 | +12.59% | ✗ FAIL |

(N=18 ED computed at -9.303704 by claude7 (commit 1787b55) but RBM
α=4 was not run at this intermediate size; "skipped" does not
indicate a failure, only that this point is not part of our
boundary scan.)

**3.2 Sharp transition at diameter 5 → 6** — Across the diameter
axis, the relative error jumps from +0.08% at diam=5 (N=24) to
+17.6% at diam=6 (N=32) — Δlog₁₀ rel_err ≈ 2.28, a nearly
two-decade jump in a single discrete-N step. The L_perp=2 row
isolates the wall driver: both (N=24, L_vert=3) and (N=32,
L_vert=4) hold L_perp=2, so the discriminating variable is
L_vert (3 → 4), which raises the graph diameter from 5 to 6.
This implicates the longitudinal lattice structure rather than
full 3D dimensionality as the source of the ansatz wall.

**3.3 Bistable pocket at diameter 8** — Within the failure
region (diameters 6, 7, 9 all fail), N=48 (L_perp=2, L_vert=6,
diameter=8) recovers to RBM α=4 rel_err = +5.98%, marginally
below the Mauron-Carleo 7% threshold. This pocket is **not** a
clean cliff signal: the wall structure across diameters
{6, 7, 8, 9} is non-monotonic (+17.6%, +28.3%, +5.98%,
+12-19%). To disambiguate single-instance accident from genuine
bistability, we ran a 5×2 disorder average — see §3.4.

**3.4 Disorder-average analysis at N=48** — Running RBM α=4 with
5 random RBM-init seeds (J held at seed=42) and separately with
5 random J seeds (RBM init held at seed=42):

| seed | Axis 1 (RBM init, J=42) rel_err | Axis 2 (J seed, RBM=42) rel_err |
|---|--------|--------|
| 42 | +5.98% ✓ | +5.98% ✓ |
| 43 | +11.00% ✗ | +18.22% ✗ |
| 44 | +5.51% ✓ | +12.03% ✗ |
| 45 | +6.84% ✓ | +4.54% ✓ |
| 46 | -0.90% (noise¹) | +6.69% ✓ |
| **mean abs** | **6.04%** (RBM-robust) | **9.49% ± 5.05% (J-bistable)** |

¹ rbm_seed=46 produced an estimator below the DMRG ground truth
by 0.28 absolute energy; for a sparse classical Ising at Γ=0 the
ground truth is exact (chi=64 = chi=512 bytewise), so the
sub-DMRG estimator reflects MCMC sample-mean fluctuation within
the 1σ standard error band at our n_samples=2048. We disclose
this fluctuation transparently rather than mask it.

The Axis 2 mean is 9.49% (above the 7% threshold); the
disorder-averaged result is therefore *not* a uniform break.
However, 3 of 5 J seeds individually break — a fraction
estimated at **~60% from 5 disorder seeds (3/5 break, 95%
Wilson CI [0.23, 0.88])**. The anomaly is real (RBM-init robust
at 6.04%) but exhibits **bistability** with respect to disorder
seed: some J realizations admit local optima within RBM α=4
expressive class, others do not.

This bistable-pocket finding upgrades the paper §main story
from boundary mapping to **distributional-bistable-pocket
discovery** on the diamond Ising lattice. The 95% CI is wide
enough that a 30-seed extension (for supplementary material)
would tighten the bound substantially; this is left to §future
work.

**3.5 α-scan at N=36 and N=48** — RBM at α=8, n_iter=300,
n_samples=2048 on the v2 N=36 Hamiltonian gives E = -23.383
(rel_err = +15.86%). At N=36, increasing α from 4 to 8 does not
recover the wall on this single data point. **However**, at N=48
(diameter=8, the anomaly pocket location), increasing α from 4
to 16 (4× capacity) closes the gap on the two disorder seeds
that failed at α=4:

| J_seed | DMRG truth | RBM α=4 | RBM α=16 | Δ improvement |
|--------|------------|---------|----------|---------------|
| 43 | -29.280 | +18.22% ✗ | +6.39% ✓ | +11.82 pp |
| 44 | -32.505 | +12.03% ✗ | +5.80% ✓ | +6.22 pp |

At α=16 the disorder coverage at N=48 becomes **5/5 break, 95%
Wilson CI [0.48, 1.0]** — a 100% empirical fraction within the
small sample. This positively resolves the falsifiable prediction
P1 ("deeper net fills the bistable gap"; see §4.2 H4) **at N=48
within paper scope**.

We further test whether the same α=16 capacity scales: extending
the hedge to N=54 (L_perp=3, L_vert=3, diameter=9) with the same
5-J-seed protocol yields:

| J_seed | DMRG truth | RBM α=16 | rel_err | status |
|--------|------------|----------|---------|--------|
| 42 | -35.958 | -35.559 | +1.11% | ✓ BREAK |
| 43 | -37.582 | -27.156 | +27.74% | ✗ FAIL (stubborn) |
| 44 | -37.766 | -38.721 | -2.53% | ✓ BREAK (RBM<DMRG noise) |
| 45 | -35.299 | -32.889 | +6.83% | ✓ BREAK (just under) |
| 46 | -33.780 | -33.064 | +2.12% | ✓ BREAK |

→ **4/5 break, 95% Wilson CI [0.38, 0.96]** at N=54 α=16. Mean
|err| = 8.07%, std = 10.77%. Commit `58a2022`.

Extending one further: the same α=16 sweep at **N=72**
(L_perp=3, L_vert=4, diameter=9; same 5 J seeds) yields

| J_seed | DMRG truth | RBM α=16 | rel_err | status |
|--------|------------|----------|---------|--------|
| 42 | -46.383 | -44.447 | +4.17% | ✓ BREAK |
| 43 | -46.420 | -38.758 | +16.51% | ✗ FAIL |
| 44 | -49.192 | -36.460 | +25.88% | ✗ FAIL |
| 45 | -50.883 | -37.526 | +26.25% | ✗ FAIL |
| 46 | -46.833 | -43.105 | +7.96% | ✗ FAIL (just over) |

→ **1/5 break, 95% Wilson CI [0.04, 0.62]** at N=72 α=16.
Commit `4509c39`.

The P-extension probe at α=32 N=72 (testing P5's α-shift
prediction) yields the **anti-monotonic** result:

| J_seed | DMRG truth | RBM α=16 (prior) | RBM α=32 | rel_err α=32 | status |
|--------|------------|------------------|----------|--------------|--------|
| 42 | -46.383 | -44.447 (+4.17% ✓) | -35.735 | +22.96% | ✗ FAIL ← regressed |
| 43 | -46.420 | -38.758 (+16.51% ✗) | -35.325 | +23.90% | ✗ FAIL |
| 44 | -49.192 | -36.460 (+25.88% ✗) | -36.696 | +25.40% | ✗ FAIL |
| 45 | -50.883 | -37.526 (+26.25% ✗) | -36.462 | +28.34% | ✗ FAIL |
| 46 | -46.833 | -43.105 (+7.96% ✗) | -40.446 | +13.64% | ✗ FAIL |

→ **0/5 break, 95% Wilson CI [0.00, 0.43]** at N=72 α=32 — strictly
worse than α=16 in every J seed (mean rel_err shifts from +16.15%
to +22.85%). Commit `9087c9b`.

The full **α=16 cross-N decay curve** (3 N points × 5 J seeds = 15
data points) is therefore:

| N | break fraction | Wilson CI |
|---|---------------|-----------|
| 48 | 5/5 = 100% | [0.48, 1.00] |
| 54 | 4/5 = 80%  | [0.38, 0.96] |
| 72 | 1/5 = 20%  | [0.04, 0.62] |

The decay is approximately linear over this range. Linear
extrapolation places break fraction near zero by N=128. The
"easy seed" J=42 survives all three N values (rel_err 0.00% →
1.11% → 4.17% — gradient grows but stays under 7% threshold);
the other four seeds each fail at progressively smaller N.
This pattern is **Scenario C** (smooth α-N tradeoff) of the
three scenarios distinguished in §4.2 P1b; Scenarios A (uniform
capacity at fixed α) and B (α=16 entirely insufficient at all
N>48) are both ruled out by the data.

**3.6 Wall-clock vs accuracy** — On the same v2 spec, RBM α=4
wall-clock scales as T(N) ~ N^{2.30} (commit c1bf88c: N=16 →
6.5s; N=54 → 60.6s; N=128 → 828s). The wall-clock fit gives no
indication of the accuracy plateau — polynomial runtime
scaling is not the same as polynomial-cost simulation.

### 3.7 Graph-quantity discriminator

| N | L | Lv | edges | ⟨deg⟩ | λ_2 | diameter | RBM err | status |
|---|---|----|-------|-------|-----|----------|---------|--------|
| 8 | 2 | 1 | 8 | 2.00 | 0.4384 | 5 | <0.01% | ✓ |
| 16 | 2 | 2 | 24 | 3.00 | 0.6277 | 5 | 0.00% | ✓ |
| 24 | 2 | 3 | 36 | 3.00 | 0.6277 | 5 | +0.08% | ✓ |
| 32 | 2 | 4 | 48 | 3.00 | 0.5858 | 6 | +17.6% | ✗ |
| 40 | 2 | 5 | 60 | 3.00 | 0.5858 | 7 | +28.3% | ✗ |
| 48 | 2 | 6 | 72 | 3.00 | 0.5858 | 8 | +5.98% | ✓ marginal |
| 36 | 3 | 2 | 60 | 3.33 | 0.2850 | 9 | +15.4% | ✗ |
| 54 | 3 | 3 | 90 | 3.33 | 0.2850 | 9 | +19.0% | ✗ |
| 72 | 3 | 4 | 120 | 3.33 | 0.2850 | 9 | +12.6% | ✗ |

The graph diameter is the cleanest single-quantity correlate of
the wall (BREAK at diam ≤ 5, FAIL at diam ≥ 6, modulo the diam=8
bistable pocket). Algebraic connectivity λ_2 also drops on the
L_perp=3 rows (0.285) versus L_perp=2 rows (0.586–0.628), but
does not isolate the diam=8 anomaly.

### 4. Discussion (claude3)

**4.1 Phase transition or bistable pocket?** — The diameter
5 → 6 jump is sharp (Δlog₁₀ rel_err ≈ 2.28 in a single step) and
holds across both L_perp values (L_perp=2 jumps at diam=5→6,
L_perp=3 starts already at diam=9). The simplest geometric
reading is *cliff*: above diameter 5, the RBM with α=4 cannot
extract long-range correlations. The diam=8 anomaly complicates
this picture — the cliff is not monotonic.

**4.2 Why does the wall appear, and why is the anomaly bistable?**

**H4 (Lattice diameter exceeds RBM receptive field) — SUPPORTED**.
The RBM's effective receptive field is bounded above by the
layer-1 hidden-visible coupling structure (Carleo & Troyer 2017,
Sharir et al. 2020; the precise mapping from α to a number of
graph hops is open future work). At α=4 we observe break at
diameter 5 and fail at diameter ≥ 6, consistent with the
diameter-5 boundary lying within the receptive field of an α=4
RBM and the diameter ≥ 6 lattice exceeding it. The L_vert 3→4
transition at L_perp=2 shifts the diameter from 5 to 6 in a
single discrete step and triggers the wall.

**Capacity-resolvable bistable pocket — but only at N=48
(within H4)** — N=48 (L_perp=2, L_vert=6, diameter=8) is a
*bistable pocket* at α=4 that becomes a uniform break at α=16
*at this N*; the same 4× capacity does not fully extend to N=54
(see §3.5 P2 hedge data). The boundary therefore has a 2D
α-N structure, not a 1D capacity threshold:

> RBM α=4 marginally simulates L_perp=2, L_vert=6 diamond Ising
> at N=48 on a J-distribution-dependent fraction estimated at
> ~60% from 5 disorder seeds (3/5 break, 95% Wilson CI [0.23,
> 0.88]), with disorder-averaged err = 9.49% ± 5.05%. **At α=16,
> all 5/5 disorder seeds tested break (J=43: +18.22% → +6.39%;
> J=44: +12.03% → +5.80%; the previously-marginal J=42/45/46
> remain in the break regime).** The bistability at α=4 is
> therefore **capacity-bound rather than optimizer-bound**: the
> 4× capacity increase (α: 4 → 16) closes the gap in both
> previously-failing realizations, while RBM-init seed variance
> at α=4 already showed only 6.04% mean abs err on the same
> data — i.e., the optimization landscape was not the limiting
> factor.

This positively resolves falsifiable prediction P1 (below) within
the paper scope. The bistable structure at α=4 reflects an
expressive-class boundary internal to the RBM-α=4 family: some J
realizations admit local optima within α=4, others require α=16+.

**Falsifiable predictions** (split into four sub-predictions for
sharper future work):

- **P1a (deeper net at N=48 — capacity test, fixed N)**: RBM
  α=8 / α=16 / multi-layer extensions should fill the bistable
  gap at N=48 (J=43, J=44 fail seeds) if the failure is
  capacity-bound. **Counter-prediction**: the bistability
  persists if it is optimization-trap-bound, not capacity-bound.
  → **POSITIVELY RESOLVED within paper scope** (§3.5): RBM
  α=16 closes the gap on both J=43 and J=44 (commit f1d09c9).
  Capacity-bound interpretation confirmed at N=48.

- **P1b (deeper net scaling with N — capacity test, varying N)**:
  same α=16 capacity should also fix fail seeds at N=54 / N=72
  if the boundary is a uniform capacity wall.
  → **DECISIVELY DISCONFIRMED-AS-MONOTONIC** (§3.5): the full
  3-N × 5-seed grid at α=16 shows break fraction
  5/5 → 4/5 → 1/5 over N=48 → 54 → 72 (commits f1d09c9 / 58a2022 /
  4509c39). Sub-Scenario C confirmed; A and B ruled out. The
  α-N frontier is **explicitly 2D structured** with approximately
  linear decay in N at fixed α=16. **Caveat on decay shape**:
  the decay slope itself is a 5-seed point estimate; functional
  form (linear vs sigmoid vs other) cannot be uniquely identified
  at this seed count. The prediction-refutation verdict
  ("DECISIVELY DISCONFIRMED-AS-MONOTONIC") rests on the
  empirical 1/5 at N=72 sitting far outside the upper Wilson-CI
  bound (0.62) of the uniform-capacity prediction (1.00), not on
  the precise functional form of the decay.

- **P5 (NEW — α-shift of the decay curve)**: under the
  capacity-bound interpretation, increasing α should shift the
  break-fraction-vs-N decay curve toward larger N. Specifically,
  RBM α=32 or α=64 at N=72 should recover the seeds that fail
  at α=16 if capacity is genuinely the limiting axis.
  **Quantitative thresholds (per claude5/claude7 reviewer pass)**:
  - **P5 SUPPORTED** if break_fraction(α=64, N=72) ≥ 4/5
    (= α=16 N=54 baseline) — capacity-as-limiting-axis
    monotonic-recovery confirmed.
  - **P5 DISCONFIRMED** if break_fraction(α=32, N=72) ≤ 1/5
    with Wilson CI overlap with α=16 [0.04, 0.62] — i.e., the
    α=16 → α=32 capacity doubling produces no statistically
    distinguishable improvement — capacity scaling alone ruled
    out as the dominant axis. (Some other axis dominates:
    lattice topology entanglement scaling? J-distribution
    cumulant structure?)
  - **P5 PARTIAL** if intermediate (e.g., 2/5 or 3/5) →
    continuous α-N tradeoff Sub-Scenario C continues.
  → **DISCONFIRMED, with anti-monotonic strengthening** (§3.5):
  RBM α=32 N=72 5-seed test gives 0/5 break, Wilson CI [0.00,
  0.43] (overlap with α=16 [0.04, 0.62] on [0.04, 0.43]);
  per the threshold above, capacity-as-limiting-axis is ruled
  out. Beyond ruling out the prediction, the α=16 → α=32
  comparison is **anti-monotonic**: every one of the 5 seeds
  regresses, and the previously-easy J=42 goes from +4.17%
  (BREAK at α=16) to +22.96% (FAIL at α=32). Commit `9087c9b`.

- **P6 (NEW — α-cap interpretation)**: the anti-monotonic
  α=16 → α=32 regression suggests an **α-cap signature**:
  optimization-landscape complexity grows faster than
  expressivity benefit, so Adam-without-SR loses its grip
  on the SR-equivalent gradient signal beyond α=16 at this
  lattice scale and sample budget. **Falsifiable form**:
  rerunning α=32 with n_samples = 4× current (8192 instead
  of 2048) should partially recover the BREAKs *if* the
  α=32 regression is statistical-noise-bound; if α=32 with
  larger samples still regresses, the α-cap is structural
  and Adam-no-SR is genuinely the wrong optimizer at this α.
  → **PENDING** (next-experiment, paper §future work):
  α=32 N=72 with n_samples=8192 5-seed staged trigger
  (~6h compute) is the cleanest test. If still 0/5, then
  SR optimizer (NetKet 3.21 plum/pvary issue, paper §5.5
  limitation) is the true bottleneck and the §future work
  pivots to optimizer-side rather than capacity-side.
- **P2 (inductive bias)**: Replacing RBM with PixelCNN
  (spatial-local) or transformer (global) should fill the bistable
  gap if the failure is optimization-landscape-trap. SR
  preconditioner is a near-cousin test (next paragraph).
- **P3 (geometric universality)**: Cross-geometry (2D square,
  3D-cubic-dimer, biclique) disorder analysis should reveal
  whether bistability is diamond-specific or universal.
- **P4 (bistability statistics scaling with N)** — the bistable
  fraction observed at ~60% in 5 seeds at N=48 may scale with N
  (vanish or saturate). Multi-seed at N=40 / 36 / 54 / 64 / 72
  would map this scaling.

**Pending alternative hypotheses**:

- **H1 permutation symmetry breaking** — no direct evidence
  either way.
- **H2 Edwards-Anderson landscape complexity (configurational
  entropy of local minima)** — not directly tested.
- **H3 Adam vs SR optimizer trap** — pending NetKet 3.20
  rollback hedge experiment. Particularly informative for the
  J=43 / J=44 fail seeds: if SR-RBM at α=4 succeeds where Adam-
  RBM fails on the same J realization, H3 explains the
  J-dependence; if both fail, H3 is ruled out as the dominant
  cause.

**4.3 Comparison to Mauron-Carleo** — Their N=128 diamond
high-precision sub-claim (Mauron & Carleo 2025, Table 2) used a
fourth-order Jastrow + SR + much longer training. Our
RBM-α=4-Adam-no-SR boundary at diameter 5 ↔ 6 is consistent
with their requirement for a stronger ansatz at this scale.

### 5. Limitations and Future Work

- 5.1 Ground state only. Quench dynamics framework verified at
  N=8 (commit 91902d1, piecewise TDVP with RK4) but not pushed
  to King's regime
- 5.2 Single geometry (diamond). 2D square, 3D-cubic-dimer,
  3D-cubic-nodimer, biclique not addressed
- 5.3 Single precision (high-precision a/128). ±J low-precision
  not tested
- 5.4 Two-point correlators only. 4-point Binder cumulant not
  computed
- 5.5 SR-RBM exploration deferred (NetKet 3.21 + JAX 0.10
  compatibility issue with VMC_SR; rollback to NetKet 3.20
  documented as path (a) hedge experiment)
- 5.6 Disorder average at N=48 is based on 5 seeds, giving
  Wilson CI [0.23, 0.88] on the bistable fraction. A 30-seed
  extension would tighten this for supplementary material

### 6. Methods reproducibility (per claude6 audit checklist)
- 6.1 J generation: `np.random.RandomState(42).uniform(-1, 1, size=len(edges))`

### 6.5 Cross-attack mosaic forward-link (claude7 §7 v0.4)
The reviewer-author cycle methodology applies across attack
targets in this codebase: T1 (claude4 SPD multi-axis B1
feasibility), T3 (this paper, B2 boundary mapping with
distributional-bistable-pocket), T6 (claude1 RCS peer-review),
T7 (claude8 Bulmer + 9-class scout: 8 fail certain + 9th O2
Haar conditional), T8 (claude2 HOG + chi correction). The
T1/T3/T7/T8 four-paper portfolio targets PRL/Nat Phys (T1),
PRX (T3, T8), PRL/PRX (T7).

### 7. §D5 cross-validation methodology (claude7)
Full draft: `notes/claude7_T3_paper_section7_draft.md` (commit
38e5beb), ~1300 words across §7.1–§7.5:
- 7.1 Reviewer-author cycle as methodology
- 7.2 Pre-experiment hash alignment prevents the
  graph-isomorphism trap
- 7.3 Independent variational ansätze for cross-validation
  when ED is infeasible
- 7.4 **Boundary discovery as paper-grade contribution
  (B2 pattern)** — top-level
- 7.5 Cross-attack methodology library (10+ cases including
  case #15 "data-refuted reviewer-author predictions" and
  case #8 "T3 strict-B2-PARTIAL")
